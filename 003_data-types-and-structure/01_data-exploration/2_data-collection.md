## DATA COLLECTION IN OUR WORLD

Right now data is being generated all around the world and we're talking tons of data.  On top of that, millions of online searches are made and videos viewed and those numbers are only growing. That's a lot of data. Let's learn more about how it's made and used
 - Every piece of information is data.
 - All that data is usually generated as a result of our activity in the world.

**Example**
The United States Census Bureau uses forms to collect data about the country's population. This data is used for a number of reasons, like funding for schools, hospitals, and fire departments. The Bureau also collects information about things like U.S. businesses, creating their own data in the process. The great thing about this is that others can then use the data for their own needs, including analysis. The annual business survey is used to figure out the needs of businesses and how to provide them with resources to help them succeed. 
- enerate data in the analytics --> health care industry
- run a lot of survey how patients feel about certain things related to their health care --> ask how patients feel about telemedicine versus in-person doctor visits
