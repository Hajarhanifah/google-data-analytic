- effective questions help you to make the most of all the data analysis phases
- In the ask step, define the problem we're solving and make sure that we fully understand stakeholder expectations.
- Structured thinking is the process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying the options.
- In this process (Structured thinking), you address a vague, complex problem by breaking it down into smaller steps, and then those steps lead you to a logical solution.

  ## Take Action With Data
  
  **Ex**
  - Gaming Repair company who want to expand his business.
    - advertising is a proven way to get more customers, but the owner was'nt sure ehere
      to start --> Hire data analyst to implement advertising strategies
    - One of the key things to think about when choosing an advertising method is your
      target audience, in other words, the specific people you're trying to reach
    - The second thing to think about is your budget and how much the different
      advertising methods will cost (For instance, a TV ad is likely to be more
      expensive than a radio ad. A large billboard will probably cost more than a small
      poster on the back of a city bus.)

      **_what wuld data analyst do?_**
      - **ASK :** defining the problem that needed to be solved (zoom out and look at
        the whole situation in context) --> focusing on the real problem and not just
        its symptoms
      - collaborating with stakeholders and understanding their needs. (stakeholder
        included the owner, the vice president of communications, and the director of
        marketing and finance)
      - knowing target audience's preferred type of advertising.
      - collected data for the upcoming analysis process , understand the company's
        target audience -->  people with video game systems
      - collected data on the different advertising methods. This way, she would be able
        to determine which was the most popular one with the company's target audience.
      - cleaned the data to eliminate any errors or inaccuracies that could get in the
        way of the result
      - **ANALYZE**
        1. who's most likely to own a video gaming system?
        2. where are these people most likely to see an advertisement?
      - **SHARE** recommendation so the company could make a data driven decision -->
        summarized the result using clear and compelling the original problem.
