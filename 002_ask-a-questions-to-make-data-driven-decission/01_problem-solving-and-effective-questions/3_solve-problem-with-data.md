- Problems can be small or large, simple or complex, no problem is like another and they
  all require a slightly different approach but the first step is always the
  same: Understanding what kind of problem you're trying to solve and that's what we're
  going to talk about now.
-  Data analysts work with a variety of problems.


## SIX COMMON TYPES

# making predictions
  1. This problem type involves using data to make an informed decision about how
    things may be in the future.
  2. **Example :**, a hospital system might use a remote patient monitoring to predict
     health events for chronically ill patients. The patients would take their health
     vitals at home every day, and that information combined with data about their
     age, risk factors, and other important details could enable the hospital's
     algorithm to predict future health problems and even reduce future
     hospitalizations.

# categorizing things
  1. This means assigning information to different groups or clusters based on common features
  2. **Example :** a manufacturer that reviews data on shop floor employee performance. An analyst may create a group for employees who are most and least effective at engineering. A group for employees who are most and least effective at repair and maintenance, most and least effective at assembly, and many more groups or clusters

# spotting something unusual
  1.  data analysts identify data that is different from the norm
  2. **Example :**  school system that has a sudden increase in the number of students registered, maybe as big as a 30 percent jump in the number of students. A data analyst might look into this upswing and discover that several new apartment complexes had been built in the school district earlier that year. They could use this analysis to make sure the school has enough resources to handle the additional students. Identifying themes is the next problem type

# identifying themes
  1. grouping information into broader concepts
  2. User experience (UX) designers might rely on analysts to analyze user interaction data. Similar to problems that require analysts to categorize things, usability improvement projects might require analysts to identify themes to help prioritize the right product features for improvement. Themes are most often used to help researchers explore certain aspects of data. In a user study, user beliefs, practices, and needs are examples of themes. 

By now you might be wondering if there is a difference between categorizing things and identifying themes. The best way to think about it is: categorizing things involves assigning items to categories; identifying themes takes those categories a step further by grouping them into broader themes.

# discovering connections
  1. enables data analysts to find similar challenges faced by different entities, and then combine data and insights to address them.

**- finding patterns**
  1. Data analysts use data to find patterns by using historical data to understand what happened in the past and is therefore likely to happen again.
  2. Ecommerce companies use data to find patterns all the time. Data analysts look at transaction data to understand customer buying habits at certain points in time throughout the year. They may find that customers buy more canned goods right before a hurricane, or they purchase fewer cold-weather accessories like hats and gloves during warmer months. The ecommerce companies can use these insights to make sure they stock the right amount of products at these key times. Alright, you've now learned six basic problem types that data analysts typically face.
