 ## Take Action With Data
  
  **Ex**
  - Gaming Repair company who want to expand his business.
    - advertising is a proven way to get more customers, but the owner was'nt sure ehere
      to start --> Hire data analyst to implement advertising strategies
    - One of the key things to think about when choosing an advertising method is your
      target audience, in other words, the specific people you're trying to reach
    - The second thing to think about is your budget and how much the different
      advertising methods will cost (For instance, a TV ad is likely to be more
      expensive than a radio ad. A large billboard will probably cost more than a small
      poster on the back of a city bus.)

      **_what wuld data analyst do?_**
      - **ASK :** defining the problem that needed to be solved (zoom out and look at
        the whole situation in context) --> focusing on the real problem and not just
        its symptoms
      - collaborating with stakeholders and understanding their needs. (stakeholder
        included the owner, the vice president of communications, and the director of
        marketing and finance)
      - knowing target audience's preferred type of advertising.
      - collected data for the upcoming analysis process , understand the company's
        target audience -->  people with video game systems
      - collected data on the different advertising methods. This way, she would be able
        to determine which was the most popular one with the company's target audience.
      - cleaned the data to eliminate any errors or inaccuracies that could get in the
        way of the result
      - **ANALYZE**
        1. who's most likely to own a video gaming system?
        2. where are these people most likely to see an advertisement?
      - **SHARE** recommendation so the company could make a data driven decision -->
        summarized the result using clear and compelling the original problem.
      
## The data Process Works

  **Ex**
   - New hire candidate
     - ask the question, how do we know whether or not Nooglers are onboarding faster through our new onboarding program than our old onboarding program where we used to lecture them.
     - worked really closely with the content providers to understand just exactly what does it mean to onboard someone faster?
     - prepared the data by understanding who was the population of the new hires that we were examining
      - prepared data by going through and understanding who populations were,
      - understanding who the sample set was,
      - who our control group was,
      - who our experiment group was,
      - where were our data sources, and
    - make sure that it was in a set, in a format that was clean and digestible for us to write the proper scripts for.
    - process the data to make sure that it was in a format that we could actually analyze in SQL, making sure that was in the right format, in the right columns, and in the right tables for us
    - analyze the data, wrote scripts in SQL and in R to correlate the data to the control group or the experiment group and interpret the data to understand, were there any changes in the behavioral indicators that we saw? 
    - report on it in a way that our stakeholders could understand
      - we prepared reports,
      - dashboards and presentations,
      - shared that information out.
    - Once all of our reports were complete, we saw really positive results and decided to act on it by continuing our project-based learning onboarding program.
