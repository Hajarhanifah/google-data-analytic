 No matter how much information you have or how advanced your tools are, your data won’t tell you much if you don’t start with the right questions. 

## Highly effective questions of SMART Question
- **Specific:** Does the question focus on a particular car feature?
- **Measurable:** Does the question include a feature rating system?
- **Action-oriented:** Does the question influence creation of different or new feature packages?
- **Relevant:** Does the question identify which features make or break a potential car purchase?
- **Time-bound:** Does the question validate data on the most popular features from the last three years?

Questions should be **open-ended.**
- On a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being the most important) how important is your car having four-wheel drive?
- What are the top five features you would like to see in a car package?
- What features, if included with four-wheel drive, would make you more inclined to buy the car?
- How much more would you pay for a car with four-wheel drive?
- Has four-wheel drive become more or less popular in the last three years?

# Things to avoid SMART question
**1. Leading questions:** questions that only have a particular response
    Example: This product is too expensive, isn’t it?
**2. Closed-ended questions:** questions that ask for a one-word or brief response only
    Example: Were you satisfied with the customer trial?
**3. Vague questions:** questions that aren’t specific or don’t provide context
    Example: Does the tool work for you?
