six common problem types of data analysts encounter,
- making predictions,
- categorizing things,
- spotting something unusual,
- identifying themes,
- discovering connections, and
- finding patterns


# MAKING PREDICTIONS

**Example**
Anywhere gaming repair wanted to figure out how to bring in new customers.
problem :  how to determine the best advertising method for anywhere gaming repair's target audience.
- The company used data to envision what would happen if it advertised in different places
- Now nobody can see the future but the data helped them make an informed decision about how things would likely work out.
-  So, their problem type was making predictions

# CATEGORIZING THINGS

**Example**
 a business wants to improve its customer satisfaction levels. 
 - Data analysts could review recorded calls to the company's customer service department and evaluate the satisfaction levels of each caller.
 - Identify certain key words or phrases that come up during the phone calls and then assign them to categories such as politeness, satisfaction, dissatisfaction, empathy, and more.
 - Categorizing these key words gives us data that lets the company identify top performing customer service representatives, and those who might need more coaching.
 - This leads to happier customers and higher customer service scores.

# SPOTTING SOMETHING UNUSUAL

**Example**
a smart watch 
- can help people stay healthy by collecting data such as their heart rate, sleep patterns, exercise routine, and much more.
- One night w woman who used smartwatch heard a beep on her smartwatch, --> a notification said her heart rate had spiked.
- The watch was collecting and analyzing health data. -->  So when her resting heart rate was suddenly 120 beats per minute, the watch spotted something unusual because according to its data, the rate was normally around 70.

# IDENTIFYING THEMES

**Example**
- User experience designers study and work to improve the interactions people have with products they use every day. ex. the coffee maker his company manufactures.
- This business collects anonymous survey data from users, which can be used to answer this question.
-  But first to make sense of it all, he will need to find themes that represent the most valuable data, especially information he can use to make the user experience even better.
